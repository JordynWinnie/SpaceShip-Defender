## Overview:
Spaceship defender a space-themed shooter for PC where you defend your own ship from asteroids and aliens approaching your ship. As you progress, you can collect powerups and upgrade your ship to improve your chances in survival. 
The goal is to defend your ship as long as possible as more and more threats approach you. 

Originally developed as a PC-only game for a school project. Mobile and WebGL versions were ported during my free time and the holidays.
