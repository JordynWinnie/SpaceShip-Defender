    /// Why are there 3 different managers?
    ///
    /// The main idea of having 3 different managers is so that Code is easier to maintain as it is not as long, and hence not as messy
    /// The different manager names are distinct, which also lets the developer know which files to change for a specific function
    ///
    /// Though all the other managers can be together in this one file, a decision was made to separate them and instead introduce
    /// helper functions in the main GameManager to access the other managers more easily if required.
    /// This is part of using the Separation of concerns design principle.
